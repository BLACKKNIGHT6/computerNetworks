IN SERVER:
when the client sent the request to the server socket. we will call the “receiveFile” method
We receive the file from the client socket and read the file using the data input stream class
In this method, we will change the file name and the location of the file. write the file using FileOutputStream Class.
IN CLIENT:
To connect to another machine we need two pieces of information first one is the IP address and the second one is the port number.
In our case, we are using localhost and the port is 900
We make a Socket object using the java.net package
